# Hail on EMR

This solution was designed to provide a reproducible, easy to deploy environment to integrate [Hail](https://hail.is) with [AWS EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=7).  Where possible, AWS native tools have been used.

![emr-hail_1](docs/images/emr-hail.png)

To integrate Hail and EMR, we leverage [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) from HashiCorp alongside [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/faqs/?nc=sn&loc=5) to create a custom AMI pre-packaged with Hail, and optionally containing the [Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html). Then, an EMR cluster is launched using this custom AMI.

Users leverage an AWS SageMaker Notebook instance to run JupyterLab, and pass commands to Hail from the Notebook via [Apache Livy](https://livy.incubator.apache.org/).

This repository contains an AWS Quick Start solution for rapid deployment into your AWS account. Certain parts of this repository assume a working knowledge of AWS, CloudFormation, S3, EMR, Hail, Jupyter, SageMaker, EC2, Packer, and shell scripting.

The core directories in this repository are:

- packer - Documentation and example configuration of Packer (used in the AMI build process)
- sagemaker - Sample Jupyter Notebooks and shell scripts
- submodules - Optional submodules supporting the deployment
- templates - CloudFormation nested stacks
- vep-configuration - VEP JSON configuration files

This document will walk through deployment steps, and highlight potential pitfalls.

## Deployment Guide

_Note:  This process will create S3 buckets, IAM resources, AMI build resources, a SageMaker notebook, and an EMR cluster.  These resources may not be covered by the AWS Free Tier, and may generate significant cost.  For up to date information, refer to the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/)._

_You will require elevated IAM privileges in AWS, ideally AdministratorAccess, to complete this process._

To deploy Hail on EMR, follow these steps:

1. Log into your AWS account, and access the CloudFormation console.

2. Create a new stack using the following S3 URL as a template source - [https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-hail/templates/hail-master.template.yaml](https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-hail/templates/hail-master.template.yaml)

3. Set parameters based on your environment and choose *Next*.

4. Optionally configure stack options and choose *Next*.

5. Review your settings and acknowledge the stack capabilities. Choose *Create Stack*.

    ![cloudformation-capabilities](docs/images/deployment/cloudformation-capabilities.png)

6. Once stack creation is complete, select the root stack and open the *Outputs* tab.  Locate and choose the Service Catalog Portfolio URL.

    ![cloudformation-primary-stack-outputs](docs/images/deployment/cloudformation-primary-stack-outputs.png)

7. In the Service Catalog Portfolio requires assignment to specific Users, Groups, or Roles.  Select the `Users, Groups, or Roles` tab and click `Add groups, roles, users`.

    ![service-catalog-assignment](docs/images/deployment/service-catalog-assignment.png)

8. Select the users, groups, and/or roles that will be allowed to deploy the Hail EMR cluster and SageMaker notebook instances.  When complete, click `Add Access`.

    ![service-catalog-assignment-2](docs/images/deployment/service-catalog-assignment-2.png)

9. The selected users, groups, or roles can now click `Products` in the Service Catalog console.

    ![service-catalog-products](docs/images/deployment/service-catalog-products.png)

10. Launch a Hail EMR Cluster using one of the [Public Hail AMIs](#public-amis) to get started.

    ![service-catalog-launch](docs/images/deployment/service-catalog-launch.png)

11. Launch a Hail SageMaker Notebook Instance.  Once the SageMaker Notebook Instance is provisioned open the Console Notebook URL.  This will bring you to the SageMaker console for your specific notebook instance.

    ![service-catalog-sagemaker-console](docs/images/deployment/service-catalog-sagemaker-console.png)

12. Select `Open JupyterLab`.

    ![sagemaker-open](docs/images/deployment/sagemaker-open.png)

13. Inside your notebook server, note that there is a `common-notebooks` directory.  This directory contains tutorial notebooks to get started interacting with your Hail EMR cluster.

    ![sagemaker-common-notebooks](docs/images/deployment/sagemaker-common-notebooks.gif)

## EMR Overview

The Service Catalog product for the Hail EMR cluster will deploy a single master node, a minimum of 1 core node, and optional autoscaling task nodes.

The [AWS Systems Manager Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) (SSM) can be used to gain ingress to the EMR nodes. This agent is pre-installed on the AMI. To allow SageMaker Notebook instance to connect to the Hail cluster nodes, set the following parameter to *true*.

![emr-ssm](docs/images/overview/emr-ssm.png)

Notebook service catalog deployments also require a parameter adjustment to complete access.

### Autoscaling Task Nodes

Task nodes can be set to 0 to omit them.  The target market, *SPOT* or *ON_DEMAND*, is also set through parameters.  If *SPOT* is selected, the bid price is set to the current on-demand price of the selected instance type.

The following scaling actions are set by default:

- +2 instances when YARNMemoryAvailablePercentage < 15 % over 5 min
- +2 instances when ContainerPendingRatio > .75 over 5 min
- -2 instances when YARNMemoryAvailablePercentage > 80 % over 15 min

## SageMaker Notebook Overview

The Service Catalog product for the SageMaker Notebook instance deploys a single Notebook instance in the same subnet as your EMR cluster.  Upon launch, several example Notebooks are seeded into the *common-notebooks* folder.  These example notebooks offer an immediate orientation interacting with your Hail EMR cluster.

### SSM Access

CloudFormation parameters exist on both the EMR Cluster and SageMaker Notebook products to optionally allow Notebook instances shell access through SSM.  Set the following parameter to *true* on when deploying your notebook product to allow SSM access.

![sagemaker-ssm](docs/images/overview/sagemaker-ssm.png)

Example connection from Jupyter Lab shell:

## Public AMIs

Public AMIs are available in specific regions. Select the AMI for your target region and deploy with the noted version of EMR for best results.
