Although you can work with Hail on EMR through the notebook, you might simply want to access and explore the hosts. If you need to access the hosts, make sure you set *Allow SSM Shell Access to EMR Nodes* to true when you launch the cluster through the Service Catalog. 

You can then start SSH sessions on those nodes by using the Start Session feature in AWS Systems Manager Session Manager console. You can also start a session from your local machine using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or a notebook’s JupyterLab console, as demonstrated below:
